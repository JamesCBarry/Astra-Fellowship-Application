# Astra-Fellowship-Application

Hello Astra Team! Thank you for considering my fellowship application.

This page is both my portfolio and a link to my games, since I only have one: Idle Brewery!

While it’s still technically in beta, it’s nearly ready for release after just under a year of development (including 8 months of full-time work as a solo designer and programmer).

This project has given me an invaluable opportunity for growth through iterative playtest feedback and learning the realities of what it takes to push a creative vision from concept to completion, particularly as a self-taught developer.

Key features include resource management, strategic decision making, meta-progression, and complexity and depth through player experimentation and offline progress.

Future concepts aim to expand scope for further storytelling, competitive multiplayer, and additional strategic mechanics.

Thank you again for your consideration and recognition of my passion, work, and dedication to this craft. 

I look forward to speaking with you about the fellowship at Astra.

Most importantly, I hope you enjoy the game.

Happy Brewing,

James
