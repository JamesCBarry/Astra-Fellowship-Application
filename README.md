# Astra-Fellowship-Application

Hello Astra Team! Thank you for considering my fellowship applcation.

Idle Brewery is my debut title as an independent game developer and nearly ready for release after 8 months of continuous work as a solo designer and programmer.

Though still early, this project has allowed invaluable opportunity for growth through iterative feedback, problem-solving complex challenges, and learning the realities of pushing a creative vision from concept to completion.

Key features include resource management, strategic decision making, progressing through incremental improvements, and emergent complexity and depth through player experimentation. The game is designed for those seeking meaningful play that engages thought as much as reflex, formed by a passion for innovative mechanics that transform how people think about interactivity and games as a medium.

Future concepts aim to expand scope for futher storytelling, competitive multiplayer, and additional strategic mechanics.

Thank you again for your consideration and recognition of my passion, work, and dedication to this craft.

I look forward to (hopefully) speaking with you about the Fellowship at Astra.

Most importantly, I hope you enjoy my game.
